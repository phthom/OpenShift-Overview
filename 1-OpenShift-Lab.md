![image-20191012152122962](images/image-20191012152122962-0886483.png)



Duration: 30 minutes



##  Introduction

During this lab, we are going to set up your laptop to be prepared to all labs during this workshop. You should be able to connect to an **OpenShift** Cluster thru the Web Console and navigate thru the different kubernetes resources.

The instructor has already built an OpenShift Cluster version 4.x for you. 

![image-20200404161755491](images/image-20200404161755491-6009875.png)

As you can see on the picture, you will connect to the OpenShift Cluster Web UI to the Master VMs for management and development purposes. The end-users will connect to the applications thru the Nodes.



## Task #1 - IBM Cloud account

The OpenShift platform that we are going to use has been built on IBM Cloud. 

```http
https://cloud.ibm.com
```

Type your **User ID** / **password** and click Login button given by the **instructor**:

![image-20201115150426125](images/image-20201115150426125-5449066.png)

You should see the following **Dashboard**:

![image-20201115150646269](images/image-20201115150646269-5449206.png)



The instructor will also give you a project name like **labproj<xx>**. Each person has its own  project with a specific number <xx>.

> Please use that project that has been assigned to you during all labs.



## Task #2 - Connecting to the OpenShift Console



The instructor should have authorized you to get access to the **Kevin** Account. On the top right of the screen, click your name and then you should see the Kevin's account (click on the Kevin's account):

![image-20210510131013429](images/image-20210510131013429-0645013.png)

Then, the following page should appear (with **one cluster**)

![image-20210510131147589](images/image-20210510131147589-0645107.png)

Click on **Clusters** to show the list:

![image-20200405144353208](images/image-20200405144353208-6090633.png)



And then click on the cluster to see details about that cluster:

![image-20210510131412292](images/image-20210510131412292-0645252.png)

From this point, you can navigate on that cluster and look about some details like the version, the cluster ID, the zones, and the ingress subdomains. 

Then click on the worker nodes on the left pane to see the workers:

![image-20210510131449573](images/image-20210510131449573-0645289.png)

To get access to the OpenShift console click on the **blue button** (OpenShift web console) and a new tab should open:

![image-20210510131912499](images/image-20210510131912499-0645552.png)



> Please take a note of the link because we will use it very often.

Of course you can navigate in the console and switch between the 2 profiles : Administrator and Developer 

![image-20200405145301447](images/image-20200405145301447-6091181.png)



##  Task #3 - Installing the OpenShift CLI

In fact, you will need to use the **oc** command during the labs. 

From the top of the page, locate and click the **interrogation mark** and the **Command line tools**:



![image-20200405145753064](images/image-20200405145753064-6091473.png)



Locate the section concerning the OpenShift CLI:

![image-20200405145926041](images/image-20200405145926041-6091566.png)

Choose the link concerning your OS running on your lap top. This will download the **right oc** version corresponding to right version of OpenShift.

If you use **Windows**, install the `oc` CLI in any directory that is listed in your `PATH`  system variables. This setup saves you some file path changes when you run commands later.

If you use **MacOS** or **Linux**, complete the following steps to add the binaries to your `PATH` system variable. 

1. Extract and move the `oc`  executable files to the `/usr/local/bin` directory.

   ```
   mv /<filepath>/oc /usr/local/bin/oc
   ```

2. Make sure that `/usr/local/bin` is listed in your `PATH` system variable. The `PATH` variable contains all directories where your operating system can find executable files. The directories that are listed in the `PATH` variable serve different purposes. `/usr/local/bin` is used to store executable files for software that is not part of the operating system and that was manually installed by the system administrator.

   ```
   echo $PATH
   ```

   Example CLI output:

   ```
   /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
   ```



### Task #4 - Check the OC command

To use the oc command, you normally need to use a login with user and password or a token.

From the web console, click on the user ID on the top right part of the console and pick **Copy Login Command**:



![image-20200405150715281](images/image-20200405150715281-6092035.png)

A new tab will open shortly:

![image-20200405150819774](images/image-20200405150819774-6092099.png)

Click on **Display Token** and you can see an example of the login command (this command will be available for the next 24 hours):

![image-20200405150909347](images/image-20200405150909347-6092149.png)



Open a **terminal** or a command line console and paste the previous command:

```shell
oc login --token=L1QwAvotX6_CfM_F9xOenhmPI1AxrOa0eEgpSK6b4S4 --server=https://c107-e.us-south.containers.cloud.ibm.com:30322
```

Result as an example:

```shell
oc login --token=L1QwAvotX6_CfM_F9xOenhmPI1AxrOa0eEgpSK6b4S4 --server=https://c107-e.us-south.containers.cloud.ibm.com:30322
Logged into "https://c107-e.us-south.containers.cloud.ibm.com:30322" as "IAM#ultrasmartboy77@gmail.com" using the token provided.

You have access to 68 projects, the list has been suppressed. You can list all projects with 'oc projects'

Using project "labproj99".
```

> **You don't need to create a new project because a new secure project space has already been created for you.** 



To switch to **your project** replave XX with your number:

``` bash
oc project labproj<XX>
```

Results as an example:

```shell
oc project labproj99
Already on project "labproj99" on server "https://c107-e.us-south.containers.cloud.ibm.com:30322".
```



To understand what project you are using:

```
oc projects
```

Results:

```shell
oc projects
You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with 'oc project <projectname>':

    calico-system
    default
    ibm-cert-store
    ibm-system
    kabanero
    kappnav
    knative-serving
    knative-serving-ingress
    kube-node-lease
    kube-public
    kube-system
  * labproj99
    multicluster-endpoint
    niceam-cluster
    ...
    tekton-pipelines
    tigera-operator

Using project "labproj99" on server "https://c107-e.us-south.containers.cloud.ibm.com:30322".
```



Now you are ready to go thru the exercises. 



## Task #5 - Deploy some code

Now go back to the Web UI and deploy your first application.

Switch to the **Developer** profile 

![image-20210510134643369](images/image-20210510134643369-0647203.png)

And then click on **Topology**:

![image-20200405152515996](images/image-20200405152515996-6093116.png)

Select on your project name (labprojxx): 

![image-20200405152622960](images/image-20200405152622960-6093183.png)



The following sceen should appear (no resources found):

![image-20210510134811412](images/image-20210510134811412-0647291.png)



On the **From catalog**, find the **Node.js** tile (uncheck the Operator Backed):

![image-20200405152909996](images/image-20200405152909996-6093350.png)

Select **Node.js** entry and then click on **Create Application** button

![image-20200405153058199](images/image-20200405153058199-6093458.png)



The following resources will be created:

- A build config to build source from a Git repository.
- An image stream to track built images.
- A deployment config to rollout new revisions when the image changes.
- A service to expose your workload inside the cluster.
- An optional route to expose your workload outside the cluster.

You can have a look to the github **sample** repository. 

``` http
 https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex.git
```



You can see that the builder (S2I) is version 12 for Node.js in the **build section**.

![image-20200911153538305](images/image-20200911153538305-9831338.png)

In the **Git section**, click in the **Try Sample** so you get the sample git repo URL filled in:

![image-20200405153545820](images/image-20200405153545820-6093745.png)



Then in the General section, names are already there:

![image-20200405153735877](images/image-20200405153735877-6093855.png)



Go to the bottom and click **Create**

![image-20200405153822949](images/image-20200405153822949-6093903.png)

After a few seconds, the new application has been created:

![image-20200405153946293](images/image-20200405153946293-6093986.png)



On this view, you can see the name of the application **nodejs-app**, the deployment **nodejs** and the **runtime** Node.js. 

Click in the middle of the **circle**:

![image-20210510135314863](images/image-20210510135314863-0647594.png)



You can now see some details of your application: Pods, Builds, Service and Route.



To get access to your application, you have to find the route: click on  the blue **Route Link** and voil√† ! You get access to your application.

![image-20200405154548757](images/image-20200405154548757-6094348.png)





## Task #6 - Delete the application

Be sure you are still working on your **project**<xx> by typing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
oc status
```

Results:

```bash
oc status

    deployment #2 running for 17 minutes - 1 pod
    deployment #1 deployed 18 minutes ago
```

From the web console, you go to your project<xx>

Click on the black button "**A   nodejs-app**" to show the right pane:

![image-20210510140504412](images/image-20210510140504412-0648304.png)

Then click on action and then delete the application:

![image-20200405165812128](images/image-20200405165812128-6098692.png)

Then type the name of your application and click delete:

![image-20200405165859742](images/image-20200405165859742-6098739.png)

The project should be empty. 

![image-20210510140622337](images/image-20210510140622337-0648382.png)



## Task #7 - Starting a new basic application

For this exercise, we will use the CLI and then switch to the OpenShift web console.

We built a basic node.js application using the following GitHub repo that you can see here (thanks to sclorg):

<https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex>

Create a new instance Node.js application based on this GitHub example **(change xx with your number)**

```bash
oc new-app https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex -l name=myapp<xx>
```

After a few seconds:

```bash
oc new-app https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex -l name=myapp99
--> Found image 92fa44e (6 days old) in image stream "openshift/nodejs" under tag "12" for "nodejs"

    Node.js 12 
    ---------- 
    Node.js 12 available as container is a base platform for building and running various Node.js 12 applications and frameworks. Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

    Tags: builder, nodejs, nodejs12

    * The source repository appears to match: nodejs
    * A source build using source code from https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex will be created
      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream tag "nodejs-ex:latest"
      * Use 'oc start-build' to trigger a new build

--> Creating resources with label name=myapp99 ...
    imagestream.image.openshift.io "nodejs-ex" created
    buildconfig.build.openshift.io "nodejs-ex" created
    deployment.apps "nodejs-ex" created
    service "nodejs-ex" created
--> Success
    Build scheduled, use 'oc logs -f bc/nodejs-ex' to track its progress.
    Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:
     'oc expose svc/nodejs-ex' 
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
#
```



For that exercise, we provided the code (the server.js file in the GitHub and some config files). 

> You can note that OpenShift if going to find itself that the provided code is Node.JS and then find a version 10 that can match this code. Then an image stream is built with the name **nodejs-ex** and stored in the registry. Then after the build, a deployment is done and the application is running with success.  



Track the build log until the app is built and deployed:

```bash
oc logs -f bc/nodejs-ex
```

Results:

```bash
oc logs -f bc/nodejs-ex

If you are familiar with Git, Docker and Kubernetes, you will notice several activities:

- a clone of the github repo 
- npm (because it is a Node.js source) is used to solve the library dependencies. 
- Finally a docker container image is built and stored in the OpenShift registry (push)

To check that your application is running:

```bash
oc get pods
```

Results:

```bash
# oc get pods
NAME                         READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
nodejs-ex-1-build            0/1     Completed   0          101s
nodejs-ex-6df7ccf8bc-p5m8b   1/1     Running     0          35s

You will notice that one pod (job) has been completed for the **build** stage.

The other pod is running (1/1) and this is our Node.JS application.

To make this application visible to the world, you should create a **route**. If you are familiar with Kubernetes, a route is very close concept of an ingress with the association of a DNS. 

Expose a route to the service:

```
oc expose svc/nodejs-ex
```

Results:

```bash
# oc expose svc/nodejs-ex
route.route.openshift.io/nodejs-ex exposed
```

But you don't know the route url yet. 

```bash
oc get route
```

Results

```
# oc get route
NAME        HOST/PORT                                        PATH      SERVICES    PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
nodejs99    nodejs99-labproj99.niceam-ba36b2ed0b6b09dbc627b56ceec2f2a4-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud           nodejs99    8080-tcp                 None

```

Now you get the url. Sample results:

``` 
http://nodejs99-labproj99.niceam-ba36b2ed0b6b09dbc627b56ceec2f2a4-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud
```

You can notice the following :

- the url contains the project name **labproj<xx>** and the name of your application **nodejs**<xx>
- and also the OpenShift hostname (in that case **niceam-ba36b2ed0b6b09dbc627b56ceec2f2a4-0000** ) 
- using  IBM Cloud domain name **us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud**



Get access to this new application using this URL:

Example:

!![image-20200405171257102](images/image-20200405171257102-6099577.png)





## Conclusion

**Congrats !!!**  You successfully installed and used the oc CLI and the OpenShift web console thru the installation of a typical Node.JS application (from Github). 

You noticed the following details:

- easy to access the OpenShift web console
- easy to build and deploy the application, the container, the pod.
- the route concept
- the Deployment
- the wildcard DNS utilization in routes
- the S2I concepts to build the docker image
